## Introduction

The OCR project leverages the power of computer vision and machine learning to accurately recognize text from images. This implementation is part of a larger initiative to develop smart glasses for blind people, aiming to provide real-time text recognition and assistive functionalities.

## Features

- Detects and recognizes text from images.
- Supports multiple languages (depending on the OCR engine used).
- Easy to integrate with other applications.
- Provides real-time text recognition capabilities.

## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OCR-Project.git
    cd OCR-Project
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the OCR functionality, run the `ocr.py` script with the image file as an argument:
```bash
python ocr.py path/to/your/image.jpg
